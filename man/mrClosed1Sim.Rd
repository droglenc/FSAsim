\title{Dynamics plots to explore single-census mark-recapture models.}
\usage{
mrClosed1Sim(type = c("Petersen", "P", "Chapman", "C", "Ricker", "R",
  "Bailey", "B"), N = 1000, rsmpls = 500, incl.final = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{type}{A single string that identifies the type of calculation method to use (see details).}

\item{N}{A single number that represents the \dQuote{known} size of the simulated population
just prior to the first sample.}

\item{rsmpls}{A single number that indicates the number of simulations to run.}

\item{incl.final}{A single logical that indicates whether the mean final population size
and histogram of percent error from the final population size should be shown.}
}
\value{
None.  However, a dynamic graphic is produced that is controlled by
slider bars as described in the details.  The dynamic graphic is a histogram
of the population estimate from all resamples with a red vertical line at the
initial population size (provided by the user), a blue vertical line at the
population size just prior to the final sample (N1; if \code{incl.final=TRUE}),
and a green vertical line at the mean population estimate.  The vertical blue 
and red lines may not be visible under some scenarios because of overprinting.

\description{
This function is used to simulate multiple results for single census mark-recapture
study.  The user can control many aspects of the simulation including simulating
the loss of marks, differential survival rates for tagged and untagged fish, the
addition of recruits, and differential probabilities of capture for tagged and
untagged fish.  In addition, Petersen, Chapman, and Bailey estimates of population
size can be made.
}
\details{
The user can use slider bars to choose values for the expected number of fish
to capture in the first (i.e., the marking or tagging) sample, the expected
number of fish to be captured in the second or final (i.e., the recapture)
sample, a probablity that a tagged fish loses the tag, the probability of
survival for tagged fish, the probability of survival for untagged fish, a
proportion of the initial population size to recruit to the population
between the first and final samples, and the ratio of the probability of
capture of tagged fish to the probability of capture of untagged fish in the
final sample.  The user selects the \dQuote{true} initial population size,
the method of population estimator, and the number of resamples to use with
arguments to the function.  The simulation can be re-run without changing any
of the slider buttons by pressing the \bold{\sQuote{Re-Randomize}} button.

In general, the simulation follows these steps:
\enumerate{
\item a population of N fish is created;
\item randomly select M fish in the first sample to be tagged such that the average
of all M values should be equal to the user-supplied \bold{\sQuote{Tagged (M)}} value;
\item randomly select m fish to lose tags according to the user-supplied probability of
tag loss (\bold{\sQuote{PR(Tag Loss)}});
\item randomly select fish to die according to the user-supplied probabilities of
survival for tagged (\bold{\sQuote{PR(Surv Tagged)}}) and untagged fish
(\bold{\sQuote{PR(Surv UNTagged)}});
\item add recruits to the population in proportion to N and in accordance to the
user-supplied proportion of recruits (\bold{\sQuote{Proportion Recruit}}) to add;
\item identify the actual population size just before taking the final sample (N1);
\item randomly select n fish in the second sample such that the average of all
n values should be equal to the user-supplied \bold{\sQuote{Captured (n)}}
value (see note below about how differential probabilties of capture are
incorporated into the model);
\item count the number of tagged fish in the second sample; and 
\item compute the population estimate using the chosen method (see below).
}

The methods for estimating the population size are

\tabular{ll}{
\code{type="P"} \tab naive Petersen.\cr
\code{type="C"} \tab Chapman(1951) modification of the Petersen.\cr
\code{type="CR"} \tab Ricker(1975) modification of the Chapman modification.\cr
\code{type="B"} \tab Bailey(1951,1952) modification of the Petersen. 
}

The effect of violating the assumption of tag loss is simulated by changing the 
probability of tag loss slider to a value greater than 0 but less than 1.  For
example, setting \bold{\sQuote{PR(Tag Loss)}} to 0.1 is used to simulate a 10 
percent probability of losing the tag.

The effect of violating the assumption of no mortality from the first to
second sample is simulated by changing one or both of the probabilities
of survival for tagged and untagged fish to values less than 1 (but greater
than 0).  For example, setting \bold{\sQuote{PR(Surv Tagged)}} AND
\bold{\sQuote{PR(Surv UNTagged)}} to 0.8 will simulate mortality between the
first and final sample but NOT differential mortality between the tagged and
untagged fish (i.e., the mortalities are the same for both groups of fish).
The effect of differential mortalities between tagged and untagged fish can
be simulated by using different survival probabilities for tagged and untagged fish.

The effect of violating the assumption of no recruitment from the first to
final sample is simulated by changing the Proportion Recruit slider to a
value greater than 0.  For example, setting \bold{\sQuote{Proportion Recruit}}
to 0.1 will simulate 10 percent of N recruiting to the population just before 
the final sample.

The effect of violating the assumption of equal catchabilities in the final
sample for tagged and untagged fish is simulated by changing the
\bold{\sQuote{Ratio PR(Capture)}} slider to a value different than 1.  Values
greater than 1 indicate that the catchability of tagged fish is greater than
the catchability of untagged fish.  Values less than 1 indicate that the
catchability of tagged fish is less than that of untagged fish.  For example,
setting \bold{\sQuote{Ratio PR(Capture)}} to 0.8 will simulate a situation
where the capture probability of tagged fish is 80 percent of the capture
probablity of untagged fish (i.e., simulates the situation where marked fish
are less likely to be captured).

The probability of capture in the final sample is equal to the expected number
of fish to be collected in the final sample (set with \bold{\sQuote{Captured (n)}})
divided by the actual population size just prior to the final sample (N1) as long
as \bold{\sQuote{Ratio PR(Capture)}} is 1.  The probabilities of capture for the
tagged and untagged fish are carefully adjusted if the \bold{\sQuote{Ratio PR(Capture)}}
value is different than 1.  Because of the different numbers of tagged and untagged
individuals in the population, the probability of capture for tagged and
untagged individuals must be computed by adjusting the overall probability of
capture to assure that, on average, the user-provided expected number
captured in the final sample is met.  This modification is found by solving
the following system of equations for the probabilities of capture for the
tagged (PM) and untagged fish (PU), respectively,

\deqn{PM*M + PU*(N-M) = P*N}

\deqn{\frac{PM}{PU} = k}

where M is the number of tagged animals, and N-M is the number of untagged
animals, k is the \bold{\sQuote{Ratio PR(Capture)}} value, and P is the
overall probability of capture if there was no difference in catchability
between tagged and untagged animals.  The solutions to this system, which are 
used in this function, are

\deqn{PU = \frac{PN}{M+N}}

\deqn{PM = PU*k}
