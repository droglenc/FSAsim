\title{Plots typical fisheries stock-recruitment models with cobwebbing traces.}
\usage{
srCobWeb(type = c("BevertonHolt", "Ricker"), param = 1, N = 100,
  initS = 50, N2ignore = 0, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{type}{A single string that indicates which stock-recruitment model to use.  See \code{srModels} in \pkg{FSA}.}

\item{param}{A single numeric that indicates which parameterization of the \code{type} to use.  See \code{srModels} in \pkg{FSA}.}

\item{N}{A single numeric that indicates the number of iterations to run for the cobwebbing.}

\item{initS}{A single numeric that indicates the starting value of spawning stock size.}

\item{N2ignore}{A single numeric that indicates the number of initial iterattions to ignore when plotting the results.  This allows the function to \sQuote{burn-in} before showing results.}

\item{\dots}{Optional parameters that are used in stock-recruitment model indicated with \code{type} and \code{param}.  See \code{srModels} and \code{srFuns} in \pkg{FSA} for the list and meanings of the parameters.  Also see the examples..}
}
\value{
None.  However a two-paned graphic is printed.  The top pane represents the stock-recruit function as a blue line and the 1:1 replacement line as a red line.  In addition, the \sQuote{cob-webbing} procedure is shown by a gray line.  The gray line of the cobwebbing will become \sQuote{darker} as more cobwebbing lines are plotted on top of each other.  This makes it easer to see periodicity if it exists.  The \sQuote{stopping} point in the cobwebbing is shown as a red dot and the \sQuote{starting} point is shown, as long as \code{N2Ignore=0}, a green dot.  The bottom panel is the stock size plotted against time.

\description{
Plots typical fisheries stock-recruitment models with cobwebbing traces for four parameterizations of the Beverton-Holt and three parameterizations of the Ricker stock-recruit models.
}
\details{
This function can be used to explore the dynamics of stock-recruitment models for various parameter choices.

The \code{type=} argument is used to choose either the \code{"BevertonHolt"} or \code{"Ricker"} models.  Different parameterizations of these two models are chosen with the \code{param=} argument.  Four paramaterizations of the Beverton-Holt model and three parameterizations of the Ricker model are allowed.  See \code{srModels} and \code{srFuns} in \pkg{FSA} for a representation of each parameterization.
