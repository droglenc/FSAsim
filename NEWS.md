# FSAsim 0.0.3 ongoing
* DESCRIPTION: Updated.
* `growthModelSim()`: Modified.  Changed links to `FSA` in the help file.
* `vbDataGen()`: Modified. Major changes included how the simulations are made (modified from Vigliola and Meekan 2009) to allow different CVs for parameters, means, and individuals; allow a constant SE or SD; allow the user to provide a proportional age distribution (rather than assuming a uniform age distribution); allow user to set the random seed to allow reproducibility; and allowed user to control the digits on the lengths returned.  Major modifications tot he Rd file.

# FSAsim 0.0.2 ongoing
